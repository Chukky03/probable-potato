<<<Example of using a for loop in a function>>>>>

The calculatedsum is an int list, its aim is to print out the sum of each int in the list 
starting from from zero as the sum... whatever the sum is will be added to each int,1,2,3,4,5 
it qill stop at five because of the numbers.length syntax staing that the addidtion willbe determined 
by the lenght of the number in the list.
i.e sum = 0 + 1
    sum = 1 + 2
    sum = 3 + 3
    sum = 6 + 4
    sum = 10 + 5  total sum is 15
