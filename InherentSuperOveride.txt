<<< This is an example of how Inherent can be implemented, override is used to stop the parent method from printing,
but you can also ovveride and still call out the parent method by using [super,method()]>>>>>

<<< The Parent method or class here is [class Animal{void eat(){}]>>>>>

<<< This is the syntax to link the inherent to it's parent classs [Class Child extend Parent]>>>>>>>
